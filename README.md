> We conjecture that grounding ML research in statistically sound hypothesis testing with careful control of nuisance parameters may encourage the publication of advances that
stand the test of time.

> Proper application of the scientific method can help researchers understand factors of variation in experimental outcomes, as well as the dynamics of
components in ML models, which would aid in ensuring robust performance in real world systems.

> Starting from the assumption that there exists accessible ground truth, the scientific method is a systematic framework for experimentation that allows researchers to make objective statements about
phenomena and gain knowledge of the fundamental workings of a system under investigation. 

> Central to this framework is the formulation of a scientific hypothesis and an expectation that can be falsified through experiments and statistical methods... failure to include these steps is likely to lead to unscientific findings.

> “If the hypothesis is right, then I should expect to observe...”

> At the base of scientific research lies the notion that an experimental outcome is a random variable, and that appropriate statistical machinery must be employed to estimate the properties of its
distribution... Since abundant sampling of observations might be prohibitive due to resource constraints, the role of statistical uncertainties accompanying the measurement becomes vital to interpret the result.
